# iMckifyTheme
Chrome theme (customised Red-Black Shards)

You may need to enable developer mode in Chrome extensions. 
If the irritating developer-mode pop-up appears on the upper right Chrome browser corner every time you start the browser,  you may need to overwrite your PC Group Policy (Win + S & type in "PC Group Policy Editor"). 
For this case, please follow this tutorial: https://stackoverflow.com/a/38011386. 
If still not working properly, apply changes listed in a more advanced tutorial here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/46362471.

Official Red-Black Shards extension for Chrome browser can be found here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/black-red-shards/jpjlkkaalgfbbegfnjoclhfidancjpch?hl=en-GB

Enjoy!
